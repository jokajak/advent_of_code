Collection of my Advent of Code solutions in an overkill project setup ðŸ‘»ðŸŽ„.

## Features âœ¨

  - Has a dark mode and light mode version which are visible only when their respective mode is used by the user

## Scripts

### add_day

The `add_day` script creates a file based on a 'solution day' template into the correct year module.

Example:
```shell
(venv) add_day 2015 14
```

Output:
```text
(venv) [adventofcode] add-day 2015 14
Creating solution day file for year 2015 day 14
```

### generate_readme

The `generate_readme` script updates the readme.
